Jewel Hotel Website Project

This project is a luxury hotel website design for Jewel Hotel Kaduna.  
It demonstrates a modern responsive layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

About the Project
This project is a responsive hotel website developed to present hotel services, facilities, and booking information in a modern and user-friendly way. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate front-end web development skills and real-world business website structure. The system allows visitors to explore hotel features such as rooms, restaurant, swimming pool, event halls, and guest services while also providing a simple booking request form and contact section. The design focuses on clarity, visual appeal, and accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.
Project Documentation
The website includes a fixed navigation header, animated hero section, service showcase area, about section, contact and booking form, and a structured footer. Responsive design techniques were applied so the layout adjusts properly on phones, tablets, and computers. JavaScript is used to control the mobile menu toggle, smooth scrolling navigation, automatic footer year update, and booking form interaction. CSS animations and grid layouts are used to improve visual presentation and user experience. The project is suitable as an academic submission, portfolio work, or a foundation for a real hotel booking platform, and it can be extended later with a backend database and online payment integration.
